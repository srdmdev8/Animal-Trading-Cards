			<p>The cheetah’s coarse, smooth fur is a pale tawny base covered with simple black spots of irregular shape and occurrence. Black stripes of fur known as “tear lines” frame the cheetah’s face from the outer corner of its eyes down its nose to its mouth. These dark stripes keep the sun out of the cheetah’s eyes when it is hunting. The simplicity of a cheetah’s spots distinguishes it from the leopard. Leopards have more complex coloration, with black and brown clusters of spots called rosettes.</p>
